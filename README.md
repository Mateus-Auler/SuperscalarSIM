# SuperscalarSIM
Superscalar Simulator (ALPHA version) based on Tomasulo's Algorithm

The purpose of this project is to help computer engineering students to understand the concepts of superscalarity in the architecture of microprocessors.

This program consists of a simulator for a superscalar architecture based on Tomasulo's algorithm. 

This is an alpha version with the purpose of being evaluated and improved. Any contribution is welcomed.
